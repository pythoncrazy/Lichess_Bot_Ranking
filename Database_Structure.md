I plan to structure the database in the following format:

Name of Bot  | Current Rating | Maximum Rating | Games Played | Prog | Total Playing time | Total Time on TV
Super-Sketchy       3310             3310            1984        +69          2024                 876
                                                (bonus points if you get the reference!)
And now you're walking through the door! Just like 2024!
As of the current moment, I am just planning to have the bullet ratings, but if this works, I can expand it to make it for all of the time controls (and possibly variants!)

Update (4/13/23 12:55:53 AM):
I have decided that this database thing is much too hard, I am just going to store the data in a csv, tab-separated. (tsv is the right term, but I don't want to call it that)

Update (4/16/23 5:10:42 AM):
I have decided to add a column for current ratings.

Update (5/12/23 8:34:37 AM):
I have changed the format to the following:

Name of Bot,Current Bullet Rating,Current Blitz Rating,Current Rapid Rating,Games Played,Prog,Total Playing time,Total Time on TV

Of course, I will have more categories for each variant, but this way, I can have the least amount of webpages, and convey the same information.

Of course, my laziness will take over, and I will later implment this at some future date.
